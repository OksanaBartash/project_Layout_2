This is a future website that offers services to cline our planet. 
I made it myself. During my work on this project, I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Swiper and Git repository. 
In this project icons were connected as a font using icomoon.
I also utilized Figma for the layout. 
I implemented Swiper@11 libraries, converted, and compressed all images for optimal website performance.

The layout of the blocks is adaptive, ranging from the mobile version to the desktop version, ensuring correct display on tablets and other devices with adaptive adjustments for images, buttons, and text.
