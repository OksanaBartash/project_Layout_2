Responsive and User-Friendly Landing Page for a Bakery

This is a prototype website designed to provide services for a bakery-confectionery that brings more brightness and flavor to life. I developed it independently using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Swiper, and Git for version control. The site structure was also created based on a model from Figma.

I implemented Swiper@11 libraries and optimized all images by converting and compressing them for enhanced website performance.

The block structure is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly from mobile to desktop versions to ensure correct display on tablets and other devices, with adjustments to images, buttons, and text.

The project took approximately 15 hours to complete.
